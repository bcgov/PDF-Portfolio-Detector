# PDF Portfolio Detector

### Note: Has only been tested on windows 10 and Python 3.12.

## Installation Guide:

1. Download Python. Can be done by going to the microsoft store and searching python. For example, select "Python 3.12" and click download.

2. Open the "Install-Me" folder inside of the PDFPortfolioDetector folder and open the "Click-Me.bat" file. Let the console/terminal that pops up do its thing.

3. Close the terminal when it says press any key to continue.

4. Open the command prompt or windows powershell by right clicking at the bottom right windows icon and selecting the option "Windows Powershell". (Make sure NOT to select Windows Powershell admin)

5. Find the directory of your folder, this can be achieved by opening your PDFPortfolioDetector folder and right clicking the "README.MD" and selecting properties. In there, you will see the "Location:" or "Directory:". Then, copy that line of text.

6. Go back to your terminal or powershell and type the two letter cd then press space bar then paste the line of text you copied from step 5. (Make sure that you put your directory in quotations)

7. The terminal or powershell should now show your line of text. Now, type "python" then press space bar then "./PDFPortfolioDetector.py" (type all those without the quotations)

8. Congrats, some text will pop up but the application should open up shortly.

## How to use:

- The "Browse Source" button is for searching the folder that has the files the user wants to scan

- The "Browse Destination" button is for the folder the user wants the resulting documents to be placed at

- Select your source and destination folders then press the "Start" button. The application may say it is not responding but give it time to process the files. The more files there are the long it will take.

- The "Result" button takes the user to the folder where the excel files with the resulting reports are

- The 'Back" button takes the user back to the starting screen and can then select to scan folders again

- The "Close" button is for closing the application

- When the application is done and it flips to the second screen then that means that it is completed and you will be able to find the reports of whether a pdf file is encrypted, has form fields, or that it is a portfolio.

### Enjoy!
